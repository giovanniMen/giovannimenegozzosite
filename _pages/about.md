From 2015 I work in the [ALTAIR](https://metropolis.scienze.univr.it/) robotics laboratory, I had the opportunity to see different aspects of computer vision: from **virtual reality with a hand tracking device**, to the implementation of cross-platform serious games. During the thesis I became passionate about **neural networks with a focus on temporal modeling**. I carried out this research developing time delay neural network for automatic recognition of collaborative industrial processes. 


My Ph.D, supervised by Prof. [Paolo Fiorini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FsovWSkAAAAJ&hl=en), concerns **Industry 4.0** and the development of a decision support system that allows operators to intervene on the machines improving product quality using a data driven approach. Right now, I’m studying causal inference as I am convinced it can describe the way of thinking typical of the manufacturing operators which embed strong causes-effect relationship. 


**I want to combine my skills on machine learning and new causal discovery methods to get a full description of the industrial plant understanding not only the features of the product but also the interaction between the product and the whole plant, employers included, within a data driven approach**. 
Possible outcomes of this researches are to reduce the complexity of the plants and allow SME to better respond to customer’s needs, create a coherent schema for in line interventions and finally I hope to improve collaboration between academic research and industry.
