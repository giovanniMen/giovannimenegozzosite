From 2014, I worked in the [ALTAIR](https://metropolis.scienze.univr.it/) robotics laboratory having the opportunity to see different computer vision applications from **virtual reality with hand tracking device** to **temporal convolutional networks for video segmentation** in the context of robotic surgery. I subsequently obtained my Ph.D., supervised by Prof. [Paolo Fiorini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FsovWSkAAAAJ&hl=en) and co-advised by [Diego Dall'Alba](https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=6321&lang=it) with the ["dipartimento di eccellenza"](https://www.icelab.di.univr.it/) in Verona. I began to delve into **causal inference** while maintaining a data-driven approach and integrating causality with temporal models. During my Ph.D and in the following year I've developed a **forecasting** system that improves **product quality** using a data-driven approach.

In the 2022 i joined **GlassForm.AI** as *machine learning specialist* where I specialised in the application and maintenance of machine learning models in the glass industry. I am a data scientist with a strong application background specialising in industry. My expertise in time series, causality and prediction models. 

From 2014, I was engaged in the [Altair](https://metropolis.scienze.univr.it/) Robotics Lab, 
where I had the privilege of working on many computer vision topics. 
These ranged from **virtual reality with hand-tracking devices** to temporal convolutional neural networks for *video segmentation*
 in the context of robotic surgery and post-stroke rehabilitation.
Following the completion of my master's degree in computer science, I completed the professional qualifying examination at the University of Brescia.

I joined the "Department of Excellence for *Industry 4.0*" and began accomplishing applied research in the manufacturing context.
During my Ph.D., under the supervision of Prof. [Paolo Fiorini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FsovWSkAAAAJ&hl=en), I began to delve into *causal inference* while maintaining a data-driven approach. 
Meanwhile, I've developed for the company [Mafin](https://mafin.it/en/home-2/) a **forecasting system** that improves product quality using a data-driven approach.
In 2022, I joined **[GlassForm.AI](https://www.glassform.ai/)** as a Machine Learning Specialist, where my focus centered on the application 
and maintenance of machine learning models within the glass industry. 

As a data scientist, my expertise lies in time-series analysis, causality, and predictive modeling. I like to comprehend complex processes, represent them with data, and automatize tasks.
