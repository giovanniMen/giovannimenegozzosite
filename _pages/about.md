From 2014, I worked in the [ALTAIR](https://metropolis.scienze.univr.it/) robotics laboratory having the opportunity to see different computer vision applications such as **virtual reality with hand tracking device** and cross-platform serious games. During the thesis, I became passionate about **neural networks focusing on temporal modeling**. During my Ph.D., I began to delve into causal inference while maintaining a data-driven approach. Right now, I'm looking to build NN architectures that integrate causality and temporal models. 


I'm supervised by Prof. [Paolo Fiorini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FsovWSkAAAAJ&hl=en) and co-advised by [Diego Dall'Alba] (https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=6321&lang=it). My Ph.D. concerns **Industry 4.0** and I'm part of the ["dipartimento di eccellenza"](https://www.icelab.di.univr.it/). I'm developing a **forecasting** system that improves **product quality** using a data-driven approach. I am convinced that causal inference is a valuable tool to describe the typical thinking of manufacturing operators.


I want to **combine my skills in machine learning and causal discovery** to get a complete description of the industrial plant, understanding not only the features of the product but also the interaction between the product and the whole plant, employers included, within a data-driven approach. 
Possible outcomes of this research are to reduce the complexity of the plants and allow SMEs to better respond to customers' needs, create a coherent schema for in-line interventions. In addition, I hope to improve collaboration between academic research and industry.
