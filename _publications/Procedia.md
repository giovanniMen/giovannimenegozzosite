<h4>Automatic process modeling with time delay neural network based
on low-level data</h4>
<h4>Author: Giovanni Menegozzo*, Diego Dall’Alba, Andrea Roberti and Paolo Fiorini</h4>
<h4>Abstract:</h4> 
Automatic process modelling (APM) is an enabling technology for the development of intelligent manufacturing
systems (IMSs). The analysis of obtained models enables the prompt detection of error-prone steps and the design of
proper mitigation strategies, in all aspects of the manufacturing process, from parameter optimization to
development of customized personnel training. In this work we propose a Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN)
applied to low level data for the automatic recognition of different process phases in industrial collaborative tasks.
We selected TDNN because they are suited for modelling time dependent processes over long sequences while
maintaining computational efficiency. To experimentally evaluate the recognition performance and the
generalization capability of the proposed method, we acquired two novel datasets reproducing a typical IMS setting.
Datasets (including manually annotated ground-truth labels) are publicly available to enable other methods to be
tested on them and they replicate typical Industry 4.0 setting. The first dataset replicates a collaborative robotic
environment where a human operator interacts with a robotic manipulator in the execution of a pick and place task.
The second set represents a human tele-operated robotic assisted manipulation for assembly applications. The
obtained results are superior to other methods available in literature and demonstrate an improved computational
performance.
