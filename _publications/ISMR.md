<h4>Surgical gesture recognition with time delay neural network based on kinematic data</h4>
<h4>Author: Giovanni Menegozzo∗, Diego Dall’Alba, Chiara Zandona, Paolo Fiorini</h4>
<h4>Abstract:</h4> 
Automatic gesture recognition during surgical procedures is an enabling technology for improving advanced assistance features in surgical robotic systems (SRSs). Examples
of such advanced features are user-specific feedback during
execution of complex actions, prompt detection of safety-critical
situations and autonomous execution of procedure sub-steps.
Video data are available for all minimally invasive surgical
procedures, but SRS could also provide accurate movements
measurements based on kinematic data. Kinematic data provide
low dimensional features for gesture recognition that would
enable on-line processing during data acquisition. Therefore,
we propose a Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) applied to
kinematic data for introducing temporal modelling in gesture
recognition. We evaluate accuracy and precision of the proposed
method on public benchmark dataset for surgical gesture recognition (JIGSAWS). To evaluate the generalization capability of
the proposed method, we acquired a new dataset introducing a
different training exercise executed in virtual environment. The
dataset is publicly available to enable other methods to be tested
on it. The obtained results are comparable with other methods
available in literature keeping also computational performance
compatible with on-line processing during surgical procedure.
The proposed method and the novel dataset are key-components
in the development of future autonomous SRSs with advanced
situation awareness capabilities.
