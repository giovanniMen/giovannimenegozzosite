#ViTAS gaming suite: Virtual Therapy Against Stroke
#Author: Diego Dall’Alba, Iris Dimbwadyo, Stefano Piazza, Enrico Magnabosco, Giovanni Menegozzo and Paolo Fiorini
-#Abstract: 
Stroke is the leading cause of disability in Western
Society, and rehabilitation is a fundamental support to ensure the best possible recovery of stroke patients after acute
disease. To support and enhance conventional therapies we
have developed a virtual rehabilitation gaming suite called
ViTAS. ViTAS replicates some of the tests performed in clinical
contexts, thus making the integration between virtual and
traditional rehabilitation completely straightforward. We have
collected the opinion of 35 clinicians with different degree of
experience, following a customized self-report questionnaire.
The results showed high acceptance of clinicians to use ViTAS
system in rehabilitation. We conclude that ViTAS could become
an essential supplement to standard post-stroke rehabilitation
